### Added

 - Add signed `Angle` normalization

### Changed

 - Move `lerp()` from `InnerSpace` to `VectorSpace`
 - `const` constructors

## [v0.16.1] - 2018-03-21

### Added

 - Implement `ElementWise` trait for point types
 - Add `map` function to points and vectors

### Changed

 - Remove `BaseNum` trait requirement for `PointN::new` functions

## [v0.16.0] - 2018-01-03

## [v0.14.1] - 2017-05-02

### Fixed

- Add a workaround for rust-lang/rust#41478, and in the process cleaned up
  some type projections for angles

## [v0.14.0] - 2017-04-26

## Changed

- Constrain `VectorSpace`, `Rotation`, and `Angle` by `iter::Sum`
- Constrain `SquareMatrix` by `iter::Product`

## [v0.13.1] - 2017-04-22

### Changed

- Update `serde` and `serde_derive` to version `1.0`.

## [v0.13.0] - 2017-04-14

### Added

- Add optional `use_simd` feature to improve the performance of `Vector4<f32>`,
  `Matrix4<f32>` and `Quaternion<f32>`. According to @DaseinPhaos in #394, under
  the given benchmark certain operations were able to become up to 60% faster.
- Add component wise casting for the matrix and point types

### Changed

- Update `serde` to version `0.9`, and use `serde_derive` instead of `serde_macros`.

  comparisons
- Remove `#[repr(packed)]` from all structs where it was specified

## [v0.11.0] - 2016-08-17

### Added

- `Quaternion::from_arc`

### Changed

## [v0.10.0] - 2016-05-11

### Added

- A `MetricSpace` trait for types that have a distance between elements.
- `EuclideanSpace::{midpoint, centroid}` functions with default
  implementations.
- `Vector1` and `Point1` structs.
- Serde support behind the `eders` feature flag.
- An `ApproxEq` implementation for `Decomposed`.

### Changed

- Depend on the `num-traits` crate rather than `num`, seeing as we only use the
  traits in `num`. `num_traits` has also been re-exported so that you can more
  easily use these in your project.
- Use an `Euler` type for euler angle conversions.
- Constrain `InnerSpace` by `MetricSpace`.
- Constrain `Rotation` by `One`
- Implement `Transform` and `Transform3` for `Matrix4`.
- Implement `Transform`, `Transform2`, and `Transform3` for `Matrix4`.
- Fix `Euler`-`Quaternion` and `Quaternion`-`Euler` conversions. The axes are
  now correct, and the angles are applied in _x_-_y_-_z_ order. The conversion now
  matches the conversion from axis angle.
- Fix `Euler`-`{Matrix3, Matrix4}` conversions.

## Removed

- `Rotation::transform_as_point`
- `AffineMatrix3`
- `Rotation::invert_self`
- `Matrix::invert_self`

## [v0.9.1] - 2016-04-20

### Changed

- Fix angle assignment operators so that they actually mutate `self`.

## [v0.9.0] - 2016-04-19

### Changed

- Assignment operators implementations have been stabilised, to coincide with
  their [stabilisation in Rust 1.8](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/14/Rust-1.8.html).
- Renames `Vector` trait to `VectorSpace`.
- Renames `EuclideanVector` to `InnerSpace`.
- Renames `Point` to `EuclideanSpace`, and `Point::Vector` to `EuclideanSpace::Diff`.
- `Quaternion`s now implement `VectorSpace` and `InnerSpace` for the functions
  they share.
- The `Matrix` trait is now constraint by `VectorSpace`, with `Matrix::Element`
  removed in favor of `VectorSpace::Scalar`.

## [v0.8.0] - 2016-04-06

### Added

- Implements `fmt::Debug` for `Basis2`, `Basis3`, and `AffineMatrix3`
- A `prelude` module for easy importing of common traits.
- Constrained conversion functions for assisting in situations where type
  inference is difficult.
- An `ElementWise` trait for non-mathematical element-wise operations.
- A default implementation for `EuclideanVector::angle`.

### Changed

- Improves the `fmt::Debug` impls for `Vector`, `Matrix`, `Point`, `Decomposed`,
  `Quaternion` and `Angle` to make them easier to derive, and have clearer
  formatting.
- Marks vectors, points, matrices, and angles as `#[repr(C, packed)]`.
- Renames the `Vector::{length, length2}` functions to `Vector::{magnitude, magnitude2}`.
- Move `Angle::new` to be directly implemented on the `Rad` and `Deg` types.
- Move `Vector::dot` to `EuclideanVector` trait.
- Move `Vector::from_value` to `Array` trait.

### Removed

- The non-mathematical operator trait implementations have been removed from
  the `Vector` trait, in favor of the `ElementWise` trait.
- `Angle::equiv`.
- Remove `neg_self` method on vectors and matrices.

## [v0.7.0] - 2015-12-23

### Added
- Add missing by-ref and by-val permutations of `Vector`, `Matrix`, `Point`,
  `Quaternion` and `Angle` operators.
- Ease lifetime constraints by removing `'static` from some scalar type
  parameters.
- Weaken type constraints on `perspective` function to take an `Into<Rad<S>>`.
- Add `Angle::new` for constructing angles from a unitless scalar.
- Implement assignment operators for nightly builds, enabled by the `"unstable"`
  feature.

### Changed
- `Vector`, `Matrix`, `Point`, and `Angle` are now constrained to require
  specific operators to be overloaded. This means that generic code can now use
  operators, instead of the operator methods.
- Take a `Rad` for `ProjectionFov::fovy`, rather than arbitrary `Angle`s. This
  simplifies the signature of `PerspectiveFov` from `PerspectiveFov<S, A>` to
  `PerspectiveFov<S>`.
- The following trait constraints were removed from `Angle`: `Debug`,
  `ScalarConv`, `Into<Rad<S>>`, `Into<Deg<S>>`.
- `Angle` no longer requires `One`, and the implementations have been removed
  from `Deg` and `Rad`. This is because angles do not close over multiplication,
  and therefore cannot have a multiplicative identity. If we were truly accurate,
  `Angle * Angle` would return an `Angle^2` (not supported by the current api).
- Make remainder operators on `Angle`s make sense from the perspective of
  dimensional analysis.
- Moved free trigonometric functions onto `Angle`.

### Removed
- Remove redundant `Point::{min, max}` methods - these are now covered by the
  `Array::{min, max}` methods that were introduced in 0.5.0.
- Removed `ToComponents`, `ToComponents2`, and `ToComponents3`. If you were
  relying on `ToComponents::decompose`, you can produce the same effect by
  accessing the fields on `Decomposed` directly. To create the scale vector,
  use: `Vector::from_value(transform.scale)`.
- Removed `CompositeTransform`, `CompositeTransform2`, and `CompositeTransform3`.
- Remove `Vector::one`. Vectors don't really have a multiplicative identity.
  If you really want a `one` vector, you can do something like:
  `Vector::from_value(1.0)`.
- Remove operator methods from `Vector`, `Matrix`, `Point`, and `Angle` traits
  in favor of operator overloading.
- Remove `*_self` methods from `Vector`, `Matrix`, `Point`, and `Angle`. The
  operator methods can be used via the unstable assignment operators.
- Remove `#[derive(Hash)]` from `Deg` and `Rad`. This could never really be used
  these types, because they expect to be given a `BaseFloat` under normal
  circumstances.

## [v0.6.0] - 2015-12-12

### Added
- This CHANGELOG for keeping track of notable changes.
- `Matrix4::{from_scale, from_nonuniform_scale}` for easily constructing
  homogeneous scale matrices.

### Changed
- Renamed `SquareMatrix::one` to `SquareMatrix::identity`. `identity` is easier
  to search for,
  and the more common name for the multiplicative identity for matrices.
- Matrix impls have now been constrained to `S: BaseFloat`.

## [v0.5.0] - 2015-11-20

### Changed
- Take many point and vector parameters by value.
- Take point and vector operator overloads by value.
- Divide `Matrix` trait into `Matrix` and `SquareMatrix`, opening the door for
  non-square matrices in the future.
- Make many trait type parameters associated types.
- Move element-wise methods from `Vector` and `Point` onto the `Array1` trait,
  and rename it to `Array`.
- Make pointer access methods on `Array` match the naming scheme of those in the
  standard library.

### Removed
- Removed collision types: `Ray`, `Plane`, `Frustum`, `Aabb2`, `Aabb3` `Obb2`,
  `Obb3` `Sphere`, `Cylinder`. These can now be found at
  [csherratt/collision-rs](https://github.com/csherratt/collision-rs).
- Remove `Array2` trait, moving methods onto the `Matrix` trait.
